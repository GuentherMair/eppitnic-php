THINGS STILL TO DO OR NICE TO HAVE
==================================

TODO 1
------
Implement internal handling functions for all possible answers to polling
requests of type "Req" as described in the official technical guidelines.

TODO 2
------
Implement a client-daemon with session keep-alive functionality. Btw. this
is not necessary to pass the accreditation test (simply don't log out), but
would be rather important if the library was to be used by registrars with
a very high registration rate.
After a little testing the PEAR System_Daemon class seems to be the right
starting point... just see the "daemonize/" folder. Any help would be welcome
and that includes testing and finding bugs too...
