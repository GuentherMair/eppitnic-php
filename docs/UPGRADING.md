# Upgrading from 6.x

Upgrading a 6.x installation to 7.0 converts `config.xml`, migrates the
database in place and replaces the web interface and CLI scripts with a REST
API and `bin/eppitnic`. **Back up the database first:** the migration drops
data for good and rebuilds every text column, and re-running it undoes
neither. Rehearse on a staging copy.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1 or later, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) — dependencies
  are no longer shipped in the repository.
- A full backup of the 6.x database, and a staging copy to rehearse on.
- The 6.x `config.xml`.

## Export what the migration destroys

Recoverable only from a backup afterwards:

- the **`accounting` table**, dropped in full — invoicing has left this
  codebase, to be reimplemented elsewhere
- **`users.billingID`**, dropped — export it if you need the mapping

The migration also drops `users.dns`, which nothing reads.

## Upgrade step by step

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. Convert the configuration and migrate the database:

   ```bash
   bin/eppitnic config migrate
   ```

   This converts `config.xml` into `config/config.php` plus the `settings`
   table, and the first connection migrates the schema (see "What the
   migration does"). Afterwards `config.xml` is unused and can be archived.
   Don't use `eppitnic setup` here: it installs `config/mariadb-schema.sql`
   into an empty database, for a new installation.
3. Create an admin. 6.x had no admin role, so the migration leaves none:

   ```bash
   bin/eppitnic user create <ADMIN_USERNAME> --password='<ADMIN_PASSWORD>' --role=admin
   ```

4. Reset every other user's password as that admin, through
   `PUT /v1/changepassword/{id}`. 6.x stored MD5 hashes, which 7.0 cannot
   convert, so no other login works until its password is reset.
5. Review the resellers the migration created: rename them, set their
   quotas, and add further users.
6. Point the web server's document root at `public/`, with every request that
   isn't a real file routed to `public/index.php` (see "Configure the web
   server" in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)).
7. Replace the 6.x cron entries with the single `cron run` line (see
   "Scheduled jobs" in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)).
8. Point your client at the REST API ([API.md](API.md)). The PHP/Smarty/jQuery
   web interface is gone; clients authenticate with bearer tokens instead of
   PHP sessions.

## What the migration does

`Config` compares `settings.schema_version` with `SCHEMA_VERSION` on every
initialization and applies the `config/mariadb-schema-upgrade-*.sql` steps in
order. From 6.x that means:

- **Pre-flight checks** run first, read-only, and abort with the database
  untouched on a problem. In practice that is domain names or usernames
  (usernames are unique now) that would collide under the new collation,
  which ignores case, accents and trailing spaces. Resolve those and re-run.
- Tables lose their `tbl_` prefix and are converted to `utf8mb4`; columns are
  renamed from camelCase to snake_case, and `reminder` becomes `tasks`.
- HTML entities 6.x stored in text columns are decoded (`Rossi &amp; Figli`
  becomes `Rossi & Figli`).
- **Resellers** are introduced: contacts, domains and pending transfers
  belong to a reseller instead of a user, and every user gets a role
  (`admin`, `manager`, `user`). Nobody sees more afterwards than before:
  - reseller 1, "Registrar (self)", gets user 1 — the account 6.x filled in
    when no owner was given — together with user 1's defaults;
  - every other user gets a reseller of their own, named after the username,
    with their daily quota and default tech contacts;
  - every migrated user becomes their reseller's `manager` and keeps
    receiving notification emails;
  - contacts, domains and transfers follow their owner into that reseller.

The migration's verification part lists where every user landed (6i) and
reports any domain whose registrant belongs to another reseller (6h).

`handleID` (MyISAM, utf8mb3) is left alone; it belongs to no schema still in
use. Drop it yourself once you have confirmed it is unneeded.

## Breaking changes for code using the library

- Classes moved from `Net/EPP` to `src/` under the `Eppitnic\` namespace and
  are loaded by Composer's autoloader: `Net_EPP_IT_Domain` is
  `Eppitnic\Epp\Domain`, `Net_EPP_Client` is `Eppitnic\Epp\Client`, and so on.
- `Net_EPP_StorageDB` and `Net_EPP_StorageInterface` are gone; persistence
  uses RedBeanPHP's `R::` facade directly. Custom storage backends need
  rewriting.
- The `CLI/`, `examples/` and `cronjobs/` scripts are gone, replaced by
  `bin/eppitnic` commands. WSDL support is gone.
- `Domain->get('tech')` always returns an array (handle => handle). It
  returned a bare string for a single technical contact — drop any branch
  special-casing that.
- `Domain->check()` and `Contact->check()` return a `CheckResult` instead of
  `array|bool|int`. Replace `=== true` with `->available()` and the `-1`/`-2`
  sentinels with `->answered()`; `->all()` gives every answer keyed by name.
- `Client->sendRequest()` returns an `HttpResponse`, so `$object->result` is
  `?HttpResponse`: `$result['code']` becomes `$result?->code`.
- Contacts, domains and pending transfers are owned by a reseller
  (`reseller_id`) instead of a user, and every read and write is scoped by a
  `Scope`. A domain's registrant must be one of its reseller's contacts.
- `users.maxOperations` and the per-user defaults (`techc`) moved to the
  reseller: `resellers.max_operations` and `/v1/resellers/{id}/settings`.

[COOKBOOK.md](COOKBOOK.md) shows the current library API.

## Clean up after the upgrade

Check that every domain and its registrant belong to the same reseller; 6.x
never enforced it:

```bash
bin/eppitnic doctor ownership
```

See "Check that domains and registrants agree" in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
for fixing a mismatch.

Messages stored before this release may carry `type = 'unknown'` and an empty
`domain` (mostly DNS validation failures). New messages parse correctly; to
fix old rows:

```bash
bin/eppitnic doctor reparse-messages --dry-run   # report what would change
bin/eppitnic doctor reparse-messages             # rewrite type/domain
```

It rewrites only those two columns, and is optional: nothing depends on it.

6.x also stored EPP bodies as `__SERIALIZED:` + base64(serialize(…)) in
`transactions.cl_trdata`, `responses.sv_httpdata`/`sv_httpheaders`/
`extvaluereason`, and `msgqueue.sv_httpdata`/`sv_httpheaders`. Nothing writes
that format any more and reads handle either shape, so rewriting them is
optional cleanup:

```bash
bin/eppitnic doctor normalize-payloads --dry-run   # count enveloped rows
bin/eppitnic doctor normalize-payloads             # rewrite as plain bodies
```

The rewrite is one-way; rows that can't be decoded are reported and left
alone.

Then continue with [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for the rest of the
configuration: email notifications, safe networks, trusted proxies and
session keep-alive.
