# REQUIREMENTS

1) PHP7, PHP8 (might still work with PHP5)
2) CURL support for PHP (handling HTTP session and cookies)
3) either a MySQL database or another database including a new class deriving
   from Net_EPP_StorageInterface to handle this database
4) if using the WSDL service, make sure you give the webserver appropriate
   rights to the smarty/compile folder!


# HOWTO USE

Create a copy of the "config.xml.template", naming it "config.xml". Choose one
of the following as server name:

 - epp.nic.it (for production use)
 - pub-test.nic.it (for testing purposes)

After you have set up the remaining configuration file, simply try to have a
look at the 'examples' folder!

If you want to use the WSDL interface, there is little to be said. Scripts for
testing are included in the 'examples-wsdl' folder and documentation can be
found in the 'docs' folder.


# RESTRICTIONS

1) eppitnic includes components through 'Net/...' and 'libs/...' paths. If you
   have 'Net' and 'libs' defined in your php configuration by include_path,
   please move eppitnic contents to the directories you defined. Maybe better
   still would be to define your include_path as starting with '.:'.
   NOTE: as of version 2.3 this should be resolved by setting the include_path
   through "set_include_path('.:'.ini_get('include_path'));" (see examples).


# INCLUDED

A) Smarty template engine
B) ADOdb database abstraction layer
C) MySQL DB schema (see examples/ folder) + apropriate StorageDB class
D) sample configuration (see config.xml)
E) example script (see examples/ folder)
F) WSDL interface (see examples-wsdl/ and docs/ folder)
